Repository for paper: DOI:xxx

Optimised crystal structures of MAPSI from density functional theory using.
The final structures have been obtained following an iterative procedure with small ion displacements (ISIF2 in VASP) using a Quasi-Newton algorithm and the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional.
