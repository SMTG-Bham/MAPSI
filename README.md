Optimised crystal structures of MAPSI from density functional theory, calculated using the Vienna *Ab Initio* Package (VASP).

Computational Details
-----------------------
The crystal structure of MAPSI obtained by Daub and Harald Hillebrecht [1] was used as the starting point for the calculations.

We have optimised the structures using 3 different functionals: PBEsol, PBEsol + Grimmeâ€™s D3 dispersion correction (PBEsol+D3), and PBE+D3.
The final structures have been obtained following an iterative procedure where the ion positions, cell shape, and cell volume are allowed to change (ISIF3 in VASP) using a Quasi-Newton algorithm.

Requirements
------
To open the .cif file, a viewer such as http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/.
To run the POSCAR file: a VASP license, and the other required input files (INCAR; KPOINTS and POTCAR)
